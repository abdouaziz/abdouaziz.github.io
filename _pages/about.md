## Abdou Aziz DIOP

**PhD Researcher in Speech-to-Speech Translation**

I am a Senegalese researcher currently pursuing a **PhD in Speech-to-Speech Translation**. My work sits at the intersection of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and multilingual conversational AI, with a focus on **African languages** and low-resource settings.

### Research interests

- **Speech-to-Speech Translation** — end-to-end and cascaded systems  
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** — especially for under-resourced languages  
- **Neural Machine Translation** — multilingual and low-resource NMT  
- **Conversational AI** — dialogue and assistive systems for African languages

### Education & background

- **PhD** (in progress) — Speech-to-Speech Translation  
- **Master’s in Mathematics** — Thesis: *Rank-Based Cryptography: Encryption & Signature*  
- **Degree** — Mathematics and Computer Science  
- **Training** — Data Transmission and Information Systems, Université Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD)  

I have been active in data science and NLP since 2019, with several certifications and projects in ML/NLP, and I continue to work on applications that benefit under-resourced languages and communities.
