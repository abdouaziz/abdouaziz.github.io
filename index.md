**PhD Researcher · Speech-to-Speech Translation**

I am **Abdou Aziz DIOP**, a Senegalese researcher based in Senegal. I recently started my **PhD in Speech-to-Speech Translation**, building on several years of work in NLP and machine learning.

**Research focus:** Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Neural Machine Translation, multilingual systems, and **Conversational AI with African languages**.

**Background:** After a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and a Master’s in Mathematics (thesis: *Rank-Based Cryptography — Encryption & Signature*), I trained in Data Transmission and Information Systems at Université Cheikh Anta Diop, where I began working on machine learning and AI. I have since focused on data science and NLP, with a strong interest in low-resource and African languages.
